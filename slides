Introduction

FSM/What is a cellular automata

Wolfram code

Examples

Wolfram types

Demo
    Show Class 1, 2, 3
    gliders (show demo with 110 (54))

How does class 3 and 4 actually differ?
    Edge of chaos
    Mesoscopic scale
    Langton's ordering parameter
    Can we know what rules are class 4 (simple recipe)
    long transient
    halting problem

Class 4: What is universal computation?
    Turing machine / Turing computable
    Church-Turing thesis
    computation irrudicability

Making the rules more complex (possible new demo)
    Show that there is more to at than just the simple automata

A New Kind of Science
    Use in to explain phenomena we cannot explain now
    Chaos Theory
    emergence
    life?

Examples in nature
But is life a cellular automata?

Conclusion
    Cellular automata show insight in how our mathematics/computers work
    And can model phenomenon we cannot model now with conventional science
    especially life
